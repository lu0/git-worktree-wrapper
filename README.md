# git-worktree-wrapper

Wrapper script to easily execute common git-worktree commands.

This script works kind of like a pre hook for checkout/switch/branch to
create, switch and delete worktrees by using only widely known commands.

## Installation

Clone this repository, try with a bare clone!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lu0/git-worktree-wrapper
cd git-worktree-wrapper
```

Add the `git-wrapper-script` to your local `PATH`

```sh
ln -srf git-worktree-wrapper.sh ~/.local/bin/git-worktree-wrapper
```

Install [my modified fork of complete_alias](https://github.com/lu0/complete-alias).

```sh
sudo apt install bash-completion
git clone https://github.com/lu0/complete-alias
echo ". $PWD/complete_alias" >> ~/.bash_completion
```

Inherit `git`'s completion rules by pasting the following in your `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.bash_aliases`

```sh
alias git="source git-worktree-wrapper"
complete -F _complete_alias git
_complete_alias_overrides() {
    echo git git
}
```

## Usage

### Configure default editor

Set the environment variable `EDITOR` in your `~/.bashrc`,
`git-worktree-wrapper` will try to open worktree directories using this editor.

```sh
# Example using vscode
export EDITOR=code
```

Or set `NO_GIT_WORKTREE_EDITOR=1` to disable usage of editors.

```sh
export NO_GIT_WORKTREE_EDITOR=1
```

### Clone a bare repository

Try with this repo!

```sh
git clone --bare https://github.com/lu0/git-worktree-wrapper
cd git-worktree-wrapper.git
```

### Setup upstreams

```sh
git config --local remote.origin.fetch +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
git config --local remote.origin.push +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```

### Open an existing branch/worktree

This can be executed even if the current directory is the root of the bare
repository.

```sh
git checkout master
```

### Create a new branch/worktree

```sh
git checkout [-b|-B] another_branch
```

### Delete a branch/worktree

```sh
git branch [-d|-D] another_branch
```
